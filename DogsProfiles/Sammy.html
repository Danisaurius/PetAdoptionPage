    </figure>
    <p>Sammy is a playful and energetic dog with a look that might remind you of a French poodle, but he's his own unique breed of fun! He loves nothing more than running around, his ears flapping in the wind as he sprints with boundless energy. Whether it's a game of fetch or simply chasing after anything that moves, Sammy's enthusiasm is truly contagious. His love for playtime means there's never a dull moment when he's around.</p>
    <br>
    <p>When he's not busy running or playing, Sammy enjoys winding down with some quiet time by your side. His affectionate nature and calm demeanor after a play session make him the perfect companion for both active adventures and cozy moments. Sammy's zest for life and love for running will keep you on your toes, while his affectionate side will ensure there's always room for a cuddle or two.</p>
